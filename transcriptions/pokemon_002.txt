 I will leave the very rest. I know one ever was. To catch them as my real test. To train them as my cause. I will travel across the bed. Searching far and wide. He's fucking on to understand the power that's inside. What's in my heart? Gotta catch them. Get to it with me. I know it's my destiny. I know it's my destiny. Oh, you're my best friend. You're a world we must defend. Oh, give us. Gotta catch them. I'll hold you through. I'll carry the power through. You teach me and I'll teach you. Oh, give us. Gotta catch them all. Gotta catch them all. Gotta catch them all. Gotta catch them all. Gotta catch them all. Oh, give us. I need a Reno. Be against the battle with a Horn attack. Oh, but Gingar votes his right back. The victory is the Hittin' Ops' power of Gingar. This could be the Agalina Reno. Wait, the trainer recalls Dina Reno. Which Pokémon will he use now? Oh, it's on eggs. Now this giant Pokémon is on the eggs. Oh, what Gingar jumps aside. Gingar is moving beautifully today. It's Trim. Yes. I am Ash. Ash catch him. Is a boy from Palatown. And now that I'm 10, I can finally get my Pokémon license. Ten year olds can get a beginner Pokémon from Professor Oak. The town's Pokémon expert. I will journey to gain the wisdom of Pokémon training. And I hereby declare to the Pokémon of the world. I will be a Pokémon Master. Pokémon Master! That's what I'll get to bed. It's 11 o'clock and you should be asleep. But tomorrow I begin my Pokémon journey. I can't sleep. Well, if you can't sleep, you should at least get ready for tomorrow here. Watch this. Good evening, Palat. Tomorrow's the big day for the newest class of Pokémon students. I'd like to introduce you to Bulbasaur. Charmander and Squirtle. Each one is available for new trainees, which one shall you choose. Go to bed when this is done. Oh, right. I'm going. And changing to your pajamas, okay? I'm going. I'm going. Pokémon, I choose you! Raising Bulbasaur, that'd be really simple. It's perfect for beginners. I choose you! Fight the sword! And there's Squirtle. I choose you! Squirtle! Choose it or lose it. Hold on. Charmander, those in the Nose, say that's the best way to go. I choose you! Charmander! Oh, no! What time is it? Squirtle, what was our Charmander? Charmander, anyone's fine. Just please say one for me. Here, Gary, he's on the N, he can't do it. No one can! Gary, he's on the N! Hey, what's where you're going? Well, you must be at. Better late than never, I guess. At least you get the chance to meet me. Gary? Mr. Gary to you, show some respect. Well, ask your snooze, you lose, and you're away behind right from the start. I've got a Pokemon, and you don't. You got your first Pokemon? That's right, loser, and it's right inside this Pokemon. Let's go, Gary! Let's go, Gary! Let's go! Thank you!
